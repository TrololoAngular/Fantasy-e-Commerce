        <div class="gig-comment-body">"The Chemist is the love child created from the union of my romantic sensibilities and my obsession with Jason Bourne/Aaron Cross. I very much enjoyed spending time with a different kind of action hero, one whose primary weapon isnâ€™t a gun or a knife or bulging muscles, but rather her brain." -Stephenie Meyer<br>Ms. Meyer's personal tribute noted above comes through perfectly in The Chemist. It is impossible to not notice the blatant similarities of this female version of the death-avoiding, dangerously skilled antihero: Jason Bourne. Recruited as a young adult and trained to focus on nothing but the assigned mission... all the joys of youth, love, and femininity were lost. As such, this "adult" book resembles Ms. Meyer's YA fiction in that it features new experiences for the heroine which results in instalove, characters who go googly eyes over kissing and hand-holding, and references to intimacy that fades-to-black. <br><br>I have mad respect for Ms. Meyer's choice to try her hand at a new genre and was desperately excited to see this new release available. Ms. Meyer's storytelling in Twilight is what made me first take notice of how engaging leisure reading could be. It was life-changing for me...not the story itself, but the act of losing myself in fiction. So, I did experience some disappointment while reading The Chemist to see that her writing style appears to have changed significantly in my perspective. One of the noticeable changes is that The Chemist is written in third-person versus her historically successful first-person narrative, and her overall storytelling, while fast-paced and engaging, created seventeen hours (audio) of observing and not experiencing (for me anyway). There are several well-loved authors who are wildly successful with similar styles but Ms. Meyer's writing has always sucked me in and let me live a different life for a while. I was gravely disappointed by this element; however, I am equally enamored by having another female lead in the thriller genre. So 3 stars it is. Most people will read this book out of curiosity and I won't deter you. Check it out! I'm sure there will be many who will absolutely love it.<br><br>My favorite quote:<br>"Laugh about it or cry about it, that's the only choice. I'd rather laugh while I can."
